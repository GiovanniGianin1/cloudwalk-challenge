    "CloudWalk Challenge â€” Task 3.1 Report\n",
    "Candidate: Giovanni Gianini\n",
    "Position: Monitoring Intelligence Analyst (Night Shift)\n",
    "Date: September 3, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objective\n",
    "This report presents an analysis of hourly transaction data from two checkout points. The goal was to identify anomaly patterns in sales behavior using statistical and SQL-based methods, with a focus on operational integrity and security monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Methodology\n",
    "- Data Sources: checkout_1.csv and checkout_2.csv\n",
    "- Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), SQLite (in-memory)\n",
    "- Approach:\n",
    "    - Visual comparison of today's sales vs. historical benchmarks\n",
    "    - Anomaly detection using standard deviation thresholds\n",
    "    - SQL query simulation to validate suspicious time windows\n",
    "    - Security-oriented interpretation of anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Summary of Findings\n",
    "- Checkout 1\n",
    "    - Transaction spikes at 10h, 12h, and 15h exceeded historical averages by more than 2 standard deviations.\n",
    "    - These patterns may indicate unauthorized batch processing, promotional abuse, or scripted transaction injections.\n",
    "- Checkout 2\n",
    "    - A complete drop to zero transactions between 15h and 17h, while historical averages remained above 20.\n",
    "    - This behavior suggests a critical failure in the checkout system, potentially linked to infrastructure outage or denial-of-service conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. SQL-Based Validation\n",
    "An SQL query was executed to identify hours where today's volume exceeded twice the weekly average:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT time, today, avg_last_week\n",
    "    FROM checkout1\n",
    "    WHERE today > (avg_last_week * 2)\n",
    "    ORDER BY time;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "The results confirmed the same anomaly windows detected via statistical methods, reinforcing the reliability of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Security Implications\n",
    "- Checkout 1: High-volume spikes may reflect fraud attempts or misuse of transaction systems.\n",
    "- Checkout 2: The outage window represents a high-severity incident with direct impact on transaction integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Recommended Actions\n",
    "- Flag affected time windows for immediate alerting and escalation.\n",
    "- Integrate anomaly thresholds into real-time monitoring pipelines.\n",
    "- Ensure audit logs and system traces are preserved for forensic validation.\n",
    "- Apply containment protocols for suspected abuse patterns."
